- Encryption Workflow
  - How does `age` work?
  - Where is my encryption key kept?
- SSH Management
  - Private SSH hosts will be encrypted with `age` and stored in the repository.
- GPG Key Management
  - GPG Keys will be stored in BitWarden and pulled down with the associated CLI.
  - A default GPG key will be used for all signing and encryption purposes, but can use the local configuration to change it.
