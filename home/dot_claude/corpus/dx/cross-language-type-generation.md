# Cross-Language Type Generation

## Philosophy

Generated types are the single source of truth for API contracts. Backend defines the canonical type; frontend consumes the generated binding. No hand-maintained TypeScript interfaces that mirror backend types.

## Conventions

- **CI verification via regen+diff**: regenerate bindings in CI and `git diff --exit-code` the output. Stale generated files are a build failure, not a warning

## Language-Specific

### Rust (ts-rs)

- `#[derive(TS)]` + `#[ts(export)]` on all request/response types. `#[ts(optional_fields)]` maps `Option<T>` to optional TypeScript properties
- **Type overrides for unmapped types**: `#[ts(type = "string")]` for `DateTime<Utc>`, `#[ts(as = "Option<String>")]` for `Option<DateTime<Utc>>`, `#[ts(optional, type = "Array<string>")]` for `Json<Vec<String>>` (JSONB columns)
- **Struct-level `serde(rename_all = "camelCase")`**: always prefer struct-level `rename_all` over per-field `#[serde(rename)]` on types exposed to the frontend. Per-field renames add maintenance burden and risk inconsistency
- **Wire format casing**: when both Rust and JSON use `snake_case`, `serde(rename_all = "camelCase")` is unnecessary. Document the project's casing convention explicitly so contributors don't add it reflexively
- **Single-file vs barrel-index output**: for small type surfaces (~10 types), `#[ts(export_to = "bindings.ts")]` targeting a single file is acceptable. The barrel-index pattern (`frontend/src/lib/bindings/` with auto-maintained index) is warranted when the binding surface grows beyond ~10 types or is consumed selectively across many import sites
- Output to `frontend/src/lib/bindings/` with auto-maintained barrel index (or single `bindings.ts` for small surfaces)

### Go (tygo)

- `tygo.yaml` with `include_files` to scope generation to a specific types file. Output to `web/src/lib/types.gen.ts`
- **`type_mappings` for pgx nullable types**: `pgtype.Text` → `"string | null"`, `pgtype.Int4` → `"number | null"`, `pgtype.Timestamptz` → `"string | null"`. Also map `time.Time` and `uuid.UUID` → `"string"` for database scalar overrides
- `json.RawMessage` maps to `any` by default — override with `tstype` struct tag for known shapes
- CI verification: `tygo generate && git diff --exit-code -- web/src/lib/types.gen.ts`

### Kotlin (schemars JSON Schema intermediary)

- For multi-language systems without a shared IDL (e.g., Rust backend + Kotlin mod), derive `#[derive(schemars::JsonSchema)]` alongside `#[derive(TS)]` on mod-facing types. Export JSON schemas via a test (`export_all_schemas`). Kotlin reads them in `SchemaCompatibilityTest` to validate deserialization compatibility. This is a third cross-language type generation path — complementary to ts-rs (Rust→TS) and tygo (Go→TS)
- Pair with mtime-based schema regeneration in CI to catch drift

## Anti-Patterns

- **Hand-maintained TypeScript mirrors of Rust/Go enums**: TypeScript unions with a comment acknowledging they mirror a backend enum (e.g., `// These mirror the Rust enums in protocol.rs`) are a known maintenance hazard. Use ts-rs with `#[ts(export)]` on Rust message enums — the serde tag field (`msg_type`) maps naturally to a TypeScript discriminated union. This is the canonical motivation for ts-rs adoption
- `json.RawMessage` without tstype override — produces `any` in generated TypeScript
- Stale generated files not caught in CI

## Open Questions

- Protobuf vs language-specific codegen trade-offs
- OpenAPI as an intermediate representation
- Handling breaking changes in generated types
