# OpenCode-Specific Guidelines

## Question Tool Constraints

**CRITICAL: The Question tool has strict character limits. Violating them causes tool failures.**

| Field   | Max Length | Guidance                        |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `header`  | 30 chars   | Very short label only           |
| `label`   | 30 chars   | 1-5 words, like button text     |
| `description` | unlimited  | Put all detail here         |

### Labels Are Button Text, Not Descriptions

**WRONG** - these WILL fail:
```
"Simple perpendicular distance (Recommended)"  // 41 chars
"Treat as failure then clearRoute()"           // 35 chars
```

**CORRECT** - terse labels, detail in description:
```
"Perpendicular distance"     // 22 chars - put "(Recommended)" in description instead
"Fail and clear route"       // 20 chars
```

### The "(Recommended)" Trap

The system prompt says to add "(Recommended)" to labels, but that's **14 characters** - leaving only 16 for actual content. Instead:

1. **Put recommended option FIRST** in the list (as instructed)
2. **Add "(Recommended)" to the description**, not the label
3. Or use a short marker like `[Rec]` (5 chars) if you must mark the label

### Before Submitting Questions

Mentally count characters for each `header` and `label`. If it looks longer than a short button label, it's too long. Move the detail to `description`.
